      <p><strong><u>Company Journey:</u></strong>At Access, we take pride in our award-winning work environment and people-first culture. Each of our team members professional paths and personal stories are valuable and significant in contributing to our success today. I sat down with Matt Ringgenberg, an IT Account Executive who enjoys his ever-changing and never dull workdays.I developed my passion for IT, when I was an IT Service Coordinator for 4 years. I wanted to be on the front-line of the business cycle, meeting and servicing our customers. So, I decided to bring the conversation personally to my manager and the President of Access Systems, Shane Sloan, to express my interest in exploring. After a few meetings and training sessions, I landed at my current role, and the rest is history.</p>

      <h2>CTC will be High compared to other Companies with eligibilty.</h2>
      <p>
        our company will come with a new gamepad laptop, one that work is
        dubbing the DualSense functions control system.
      </p>

      <h2>Offer release date</h2>
      <p>
        Company has officially confirmed that the laptop will release "in time
        for Holiday 2020", so likely some time between October and December 2020
      </p>

      <h2>Laptop design</h2>
      <p>
        Laptop has gone futuristic with the DualSense's design. And, while we
        know that the laptop won't look anything like the dev kits we've seen so
        far, the alien-futuristic design may be in the right vein
